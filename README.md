This Repository contains a bunch of things I worked on while learning how to program in python
It's a bunch of old code I just decided to commit all at once.

In it, there's my implementation of a Range, Vector and some Progression classes.
The most fun stuff here for me is moore.py where I used Linear Regression to prove that
Moore's Law is still true with the data from wikipedia at that time.
